# AppsScript
At the moment, this repository is a collection of Google Apps script (.gs) JavaScript files 
that I am using to explore, learn and test the manipulation of Google Contacts data with.

I am in the process of learning JavaScript so I need a place to record all of my experiments.

I am working towards creating a program that will do the following:
1. Check through all contacts to find duplicates
2. Check to see which duplicate is newer
3. Merge and delete corresponding data to be merged from existing contact (check against
existing data - merge and update what is new)
4. Update and change tags according to client status
5. Delete the new contact
